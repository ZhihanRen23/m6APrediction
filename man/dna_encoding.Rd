\alias{dna_encoding}
\title{One-hot style DNA base encoding}
\usage{
dna_encoding(dna_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{dna_vec}{A character vector, each element is a DNA sequence
of equal length containing only A/T/C/G.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with n rows and L columns (L is the sequence length),
column names are nt_pos1..nt_posL, and factor levels are fixed as A/T/C/G.
}
\description{
Convert equal-length DNA sequences into a data frame,
where each position is represented as a factor column (A/T/C/G).
Useful for merging with model features or one-hot expansion.
}
\examples{
dna_encoding(c("ATCG", "AACC"))
}
